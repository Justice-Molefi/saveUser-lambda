  {
    "Users" : {
        "3e8hiwerhID": {
            "firstName" : "Some Nonsense",
            "lastName" : "Some more nonsense"
        },
        "3e8hiwerhID": {
            "firstName" : "Some Nonsense",
            "lastName" : "Some more nonsense"
        }
    }
  }



So there is data, and we need ways to access this data,,,, various ways depending on usage...
so we may structure data a certain way so can access it faster... or so we can reduce cpu cycles...
... Each storage service or technology has ways to achieve all these things....
That is why we have access patterns....
